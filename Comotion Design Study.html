</ul>



<h2 id="user-groups">User Groups</h2>

<p>There are multiple types of users who will be engaging with the CoMotion gap learning platform. Each of their needs, wants, and incentives may differ. Here we define three unique user groups, the types of users in each group, and the incentives we believe each have to engage with the platform.</p>



<h3 id="innovators">Innovators</h3>

<p>Comprised of researchers, post­doc students, undergrads, and faculty who are likely to seek engaging with CoMotion to transform their research or academic interests into marketable businesses. Innovators are comprised of researchers, post­doc students,undergrads, and faculty seeking to engage with CoMotion to transform their research or academic interests into marketable businesses, as well as those who would like to actively contribute to the projects of others.</p>



<h3 id="partners">Partners</h3>

<p>The various members of the business community or UW faculty who engage with innovators to take their ideas from academia into the market. They represent the mentors, entrepreneurs in residence, and faculty advisors that partner with innovators.</p>



<h3 id="enablers">Enablers</h3>

<p>Consultants, lawyers, and businesses who provide goods and services to enable innovators and their partners in building a business.</p>



<h2 id="key-drivers-for-comotion-community">Key Drivers for CoMotion Community</h2>

<ol>
<li>Creating connections / networking</li>
<li>Creating new economic opportunities</li>
<li>Advancing their understanding of entrepreneurial ventures</li>
<li>Gaining experience in their fields of interest</li>
<li>Gaining public recognition for their contributions</li>
</ol>

<p>It is the goal of CoMotion and Roosterpark to design a technology product which will leverage these 5 key drivers to engage the CoMotion community and amplify and grow the already thriving entrepreneurial environment of the UW.</p>



<h2 id="what-needs-will-the-comotion-bridge-project-fulfill-for-users">What needs will the CoMotion Bridge project fulfill for users?</h2>

<p>The need to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Acquire pertinent knowledge about ‘real world’ entrepreneurship.</p>
  
  <p>Find and make the human connections necessary to leverage the knowledge or experience they possess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While every member of the CoMotion community has unique needs and drivers, it is clear that an overwhelming majority struggle with these two fundamental needs.</p>



<h2 id="community-building">Community Building</h2>

<p>Creating communities is hard. It requires not only social intelligence and the ability to find and engage with others, but the introspection necessary to know which communities will be a good fit for an individual. CoMotion is facilitating this challenging task through a painstaking manual process that requires the personal knowledge of the CoMotion staff to make introductions, suggest mentors, and filter incoming and outgoing messages. This system, while very effective, can not be scaled to serve the larger UW student body nor the over 10,000 strong community of entrepreneurs and businesses interested in the UW innovation community.</p>

<p>We have identified three key features that can easily help CoMotion and the UW innovation to engage and navigate the already large social graph. </p>



<h3 id="joining-the-community">Joining the community</h3>

<p>Joining the CoMotion Bridge community is the first step to gaining access to the wealth of knowledge and connections that are available to the UW innovation community. To join the community, users will be asked to create a unique personal profile with information about their interests, current projects, and what types of opportunities they are seeking. The information users provide in their profile and the signup process will be used not only to help others find them, but as the first step in the process of engaging within the community.  </p>

<p>Upon successful completion of a user profile every user will be presented with a short list of members of the community that share similar interests, goals, or are open to the types of interactions the user is seeking.</p>



<h3 id="finding-your-community">Finding your community</h3>

<p>The first step in building community is to understand who the members of your community are and make your interest known. The CoMotion Bridge Connection app with do this by allowing a user to request to with another user. When the other user accepts a connection this will open a channel to direct communication.  </p>

<p>In the future, the recommendations engine is likely to integrate quizzes, personality tests, and user interactions into a matchmaking system similar to that found on the social dating website ‘OkCupid.com’. Because many of the features of this sort of matchmaking are experimental and will require great attention to detail, these will not be included in the initial version of the CoMotion Bridge Connections application.</p>



<h3 id="speaking-to-your-community">Speaking to your community</h3>

<p>To begin the process of making the community one’s own it is necessary to be able to reach both wide audiences and individuals. The CoMotion Bridge Connections application will implement the ability to directly message other users, post information publicly to the wider CoMotion community, and to communicate within groups.  </p>

<p>To prevent any member from being overwhelmed with direct communications a sort of ‘virtual social currency’ model will be investigated. Many ideas for how to accomplish this have been proposed including social currencies, mutual interest mechanisms like those seen in the ‘weave’ app, and simple communications throttling as is done by LinkedIn.</p>



<h3 id="making-it-your-community">Making it ‘your’ community</h3>

<p>The next step in community formation is to begin to refine the concept of your community by creating groups which are focused around a common passion, need, or vision. These groups may manifest as project teams, study groups, or entrepreneurial endeavors that eventually grow to become start-ups and businesses. </p>

<p>CoMotion bridge will provide the users with the ability to organize into groups, to maintain light weight communications tools for communicating within their groups, and to make public the goals, members, and other information about their group to the wider UW innovation audience.</p>



<h3 id="features-summary">Features Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>Individual Social profiles for all CoMotion community members.</li>
<li>Ability to ‘connect’ to other members of the community.</li>
<li>Text based search of all CoMotion Connection members.</li>
<li>Direct messaging </li>
<li>Group/Team creation and communication tools.</li>
<li></li>
<li><p>Intelligent matchmaking services based on shared interests, interactions, connections.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This need can be met by deploying a searchable ‘user directory’, which contains member’s contact information and a small amount of explanatatory text. However, this does not facilitate the act of creating connection, but merely alleviates an information assymetry that exists in the community. To properly begin to organize the community and create connection it will be necessary to engage users as well as provide functionality to make their connections and contributions to the community public.</p>



<h1 id="the-quest-for-knowledge">The Quest for Knowledge</h1>

<p>Translating academic pursuits, personal research and intellectual property, and personal experience into actionable real world businesses can be challenging for even the most driven individuals. It requires understanding complex financial instruments, the level of one’s own knowledge and experience, and significant knowledge of the domains one is interested in pursuing. Much of this information can be found through start up forums ( news.ycombinator.com ), user groups ( cascadia ruby ), online courses and publications ( stanford’s startup course, coursera ), even print publications ( Inc, Fast Company ), however, few, if any of these modes of delivery attempt to help the user determine what information will be most helpful to them where they are now. </p>



<h2 id="basics-of-the-bridge-knowledge-base">Basics of the Bridge Knowledge Base</h2>

<p>At it’s heart the Bridge Knowledge Base will be a publishing platform that allows the CoMotion team to curate, organize, and publish content that bridges the gap between academic curricula and the ‘real world’. The knowledge base will be content type agnostic, meaning that it will allow for the creation and inclusion of numerous forms of content deliverable with modern web technologies. </p>



<h3 id="content-types">Content Types</h3>

<p>The platform will be populated with content of the following types:</p>



<h4 id="media">Media:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Short and long form video content ( via youtube, vimeo, etc ?)</li>
<li>Short and long form audio content ( podcasts + soundcloud )</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="text-and-documents">Text and Documents</h4>

<ul>
<li>Text content published and stored directly in the platform.</li>
<li>Curated external content ( documents and links ).</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="events">Events</h4>

<ul>
<li>Lectures / Speaking engagements</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship Skills workshops </li>
<li>Pitch contests</li>
<li>Hackathons and other product creation contests</li>
<li>Publishable Events Calendar ( publish to RSS, iCal, google etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Events are a unique type of content that will include a location and and time component. Each event will be published to one of a number of shared calendaring solutions such as google calendar, outlook, and via RSS, allowing users to subscribe to and receive updates any time events are added. </p>



<h4 id="micro-courses">Micro Courses</h4>

<ul>
<li>Sequences of curated content</li>
</ul>

<p>As has been previously noted, navigating the deluge of content related to start ups, entreprenuership, and businesses is daunting even for those in industry. The ability to create unique ‘micro courses’, which entail curating and linking similar content together into a ‘course track’ that provides prospective users with a logical path to understanding will also be developed. </p>



<h3 id="finding-the-right-content">Finding the Right Content</h3>

<p>From day one it will be possible to perform keyword searches on the text portions of all content in the knowledge base. Additionally, the ability to create ‘Microcourse tracks’ will also be supported to allow for curating content into themes, or tracks, that help to organize content and give the users a sense of direction and hints about what areas to explore next. Additionally, metadata about popularity, quality ( ratings), and subject matter will be gathered both from users and content creators. </p>



<h3 id="popularity-ratings-and-tagging">Popularity, Ratings, and Tagging</h3>

<p>All content is not created equal, and all content is not pertinent to the interests of all users at all times. To help users navigate the content three features will be added to each piece of content. </p>



<h4 id="popularity-view-count">Popularity ( View Count ):</h4>

<p>A numerical count of the number of times the content was viewed by users of the Knowledge Base.</p>



<h4 id="rating">Rating:</h4>

<p>A subjective estimation of the quality of the content. </p>



<h4 id="tagging">Tagging:</h4>

<p>The ability to add keyword tags to all pieces of content.</p>

<p>By including these features as an integral part of each content piece, it will expose a simple and effective means for users to select the content they would like to educate themselves. Additionally, by gathering information about these characteristics from the users from day one, it will be possible create services that leverage this data to recommend content to users, create reports which can be used to evaluate content creators and expose needs/desires of the users, as well as provide data that can be used to do analysis of usage of the application.</p>



<h2 id="development-estimates-for-knowledge-base">Development Estimates for Knowledge Base</h2>

<p>The tables below divide the features into feature sets that can be </p>



<h4 id="base-features-excluding-visual-design">Base Features ( excluding visual design )</h4>



<h5 id="1-or-2-developers-2-4-weeks">1 or 2 developers, 2-4 weeks</h5>

<ul>
<li>audio, video, text, documents, links, events, minicourses content types</li>
<li>rating, tags, popularity metadata</li>
<li>events syndication to RSS or other calendars</li>
<li>admin only content creation</li>
<li>keyword search of all content items</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="branding-styling">Branding / Styling</h4>

<ul>
<li>Basic UX design, 1 designer, 1 week </li>
<li>Visual Design and Custom Style Guide, 1 designer, 1-2 weeks</li>
<li>Implementation of Custom styles, 1 developer, 2-4 weeks</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="future-improvements-to-bridge-knowledge-base">Future Improvements to Bridge Knowledge Base</h2>



<h3 id="user-generated-content">User Generated Content</h3>

<p>Initially it is planned that all content creation for the Knowledge Base to be handled by the CoMotion staff and curriculum creators. As the system matures, adding the ability for users to create content of their own to add to the system will be investigated. </p>



<h3 id="content-recommendation">Content Recommendation</h3>

<p>Initially the quanity of the content is likely to be manageable for users to navigate. As the content in the knowledge base grows, particularly if UGC is enabled, the sheer quantity will quickly overwhelm the simple</p>



<h3 id="badges-and-achievements">Badges and Achievements</h3>

<p>As an incentive to engage with the content, complete the educational minicourses it was suggested that a system of achievements be used to gamify the various educational oppportunities presented by the Bridge application. A distinct strategy to award users who actively create, curate, review, and complete content can be created.</p>



<h3 id="location-aware-content">Location Aware Content</h3>

<p>Some content, events in particular, are inherently associated with locations and the fact that most users have a mobile device which is capable of being location aware opens the possibility of giving live notifications for events or other members in the location of the user. </p>



<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>

<p>As the content library grows, content is updated, or UGC elements of content are added ( such as comments ) the ability to notify a user via email or on a mobile device can be added.</p>



<h3 id="tests-surveys-quizzes">Tests, Surveys, Quizzes</h3>

<p>There is a plethora of valuable information that deals with both personal introspection ( Myers Briggs, Eneagram, Gallup StrengthsFinder ) and allows users to understand more about others. Sites such as OKCupid.com have been wildly successful at using these tools to gather information about users and utilizing it to improve their matchmaking algorithms. Additionally, a general system for creating content of this type could also be developed to allow for integrating custom ‘tests’ and ‘quizzes’ into mini-courses.</p>



<h4 id="ugc">UGC</h4>

<p>Customizing out of box CMS, 1 developer, 2-4 weeks <br>
Full custom developed CMS, 2-4 developers, 2-4 months</p>



<h4 id="content-recommendation-1">Content Recommendation</h4>

<ul>
<li>Basic existing engine customization, 1 developers, 1-6 weeks</li>
<li>Custom open-source based recommendation engine, 1-2 developers, 2-4 months</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="badges-and-achievements-1">Badges and Achievements</h4>

<ul>
<li>basic system with predefined badges and events, 1 developer + 1 designer, 2-4 weeks</li>
<li>extensible system that allows custom badge creation and management, 1 developer 4-6 weeks, 1 designer 1-3 weeks</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="tests-polls-surveys-quizzes">Tests, Polls, Surveys, Quizzes</h4>

<p>Core Scenarios for CoMotion Bridge</p>

<p>Though the use cases and users of the CoMotion services are varied, it is possible to define the core scenarios that must be met for the CoMotion community as a whole. There are two primary needs of the user base which must be met, the need to connect and the need to expand one’s knowledge.</p>

<p>Connection and Networking <br>
From our preliminary conversation we understand that the network of potential users for the CoMotion bridge product numbers in the ten’s of thousands ( 10,000+ ). For a user base this large it is vital to have numerous modes of finding other members of the community, quickly, easily, and accurately. As such, focusing first on exposing a user friendly, fast interface to all the members of the CoMotion network is of the highest priority.</p>

<p>This need can be met by deploying a searchable ‘user directory’, which contains member’s contact information and a small amount of explanatatory text. However, this does not facilitate the act of creating connection, but merely alleviates an information assymetry that exists in the community. To properly begin to organize the community and create connection it will be necessary to engage users as well as provide functionality to make their connections and contributions to the community public.</p>

<p>Because the interactions necessary for creating new businesses and engaging in entrepreneurial pursuits requires a complex mix of skills and personality, it is also vital to introduce an ability for users to quickly assess the likelihood of sharing a good personality fit with another user. </p>
